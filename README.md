# website
A personal website to detail my work experience, education, hobbies, etc.

The purpose of this project is to get familiar with html, css, and javascript (and maybe make it a full stack project) in order to help further improve my skills.
I want to use this as a way to practice coding with new or very unfamiliar languages so I can expand my overall knowledge.
