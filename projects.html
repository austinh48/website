            <p class="work-projects">
                In my professional career thus far I have worked on 2 teams and coded 3 projects. These projects involved developing utilizing an agile SDLC, with daily scrums, 
                2 week sprints, story points, etc. Throughout the process, I have utilized many different libraries across Python, but the main focus for 2 of these projects 
                was RPA, and replacing licensed bots from Automation Anywhere. The other project that I have coded utilized mainly bash scripts with a little bit of Python to 
                automate an upgrading process for our teams digital ledgers.

            <h4>Zinnia</h4>
            <p class="daml-upgrade">
                The most recent project that I have worked on is an automation process for upgrading DAML digital ledgers from an old version (0.0.1 for example) to the new version 
                (0.0.2). This project took place over the span of several months where I developed multiple bash scripts (~25) as well as python scripts to aid in the upgrading 
                process. The process of developing this project was particularly challenging because the tool that we were using (provided to us by Digital Asset) was in the first 
                stages of its development, so I ran into bugs continuously while using the tool. However, this gave me an opportunity to experience how the feedback process works 
                when creating a tool like this. I was in constant communication with someone from Digital Asset (DA) whenever I encountered an error, and was able to give valuable 
                feedback to the DA team so that they could fix the bug, and send me a new version of the tool. Another challenge that I encountered during this project was the fact 
                that I had never used Bash before, so I had to learn the syntax as I was coding the functionality. This proved to be a fun challenge, because I was able to apply my 
                knowledge of other coding languages and through use of Google, translate the code that I wanted to write into Bash. After all the bash scripts were complete, we wanted 
                to make it so anyone within the team could run the upgrade without needing to clone the repository that I created. In order to achieve this, I utilized Azure Devops to 
                create a pipeline that would call all of the scripts in the right order. This also proved to be challenging for me because I had never used Azure Pipelines in the past.
            </p>
            <p class="rpa">
                The projects I worked on during my internship at Zinnia were both similar projects for the RPA team. I had to create 2 python scripts (1 for each website I had to scrape) 
                that utilized Selenium to open up google chrome, enter the url for the website and login, then navigate through different tabs and screens and take screenshots for of the 
                page. These projects were particularly challenging because it was my first time really using Python and its libraries for something complex. The scripts were used internally 
                to replace the Automation Anywhere bots that Zinnia had previously been purchasing licenses for at a price of about $20,000 per yer per bot (the redesign I did saved the team 
                about $40,000 per year). These scripts also ran about 50% faster than the Automation Anywhere scripts, so not only did the redesign save money, but it also saved time. Another 
                thing that made these projects so challenging was that the pages that were needed to be screen-shotted were not the same each time, and depended on an excel sheet that was submitted. 
                I had to use pandas to read the excel sheet and for each row (some excel sheets were over 100 rows) and determine which screenshots to take for each contract number. 
                For each website, I had to code around 20 functions (I don't remember the exact number) that would be able to navigate to a page based on the option that 
                was selected in the excel sheet and take the corresponding screenshot, and then I had to create the required ~10 workflows that would call specific functions within them. I also 
                had to include the option to select each one of the pages individually, in addition to the pre-selected flows without duplicates. Another particularly tough challenge that I ran into 
                was that one of the websites would constantly change the xpaths of the objects on the webpage (I didn't want to use xpaths for this reason, but there was no other option). In order to 
                overcome this, I had to continuously test until I found the range of values that an objects xpaths would be, and create try/except statements paired with if/else in order to screenshot 
                the right pages. Overall, both of these projects were about 5000 LOC, all custom code. I found these projects to be a fun yet challenging experience that really helped me understand 
                how complex programming can be.
